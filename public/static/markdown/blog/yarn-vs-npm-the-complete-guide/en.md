Some time ago, when package managers didn't exist, it was very hard to manage all of your project's dependencies. This task was also growing in complexity when your project grew in size. Nowadays, luckily for us, we have package managers that help us add, remove and update dependencies to our project.

The two biggest package managers for JavaScript developers are **Yarn** and **npm**. 

It can be quite a dilemma when choosing between them, so this article will compare them to each other and help you decide which one to use in your next JavaScript project.

## What is npm?

Npm (an acronym for Node Package Manager) is a package manager and was released in 2010. 

This is the default package manager that is installed when you install Node.js.

Npm is FREE TO USE and you can download all public packages without registration.

It is composed of:

1. The [platform](https://www.npmjs.com/) where the developer can search and publish npm packages.

2. The registry where all the packages are stored. The packages can be public or paid-for-private.

2. The [CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm) that helps you interact with the npm registry and manage your dependencies.

You can follow the updates of this project [here](https://github.com/npm/cli).
