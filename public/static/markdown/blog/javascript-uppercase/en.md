In JavaScript, to make a string uppercase, the easiest way to do it is by using the `toUpperCase()` built-in function.

This function is easy to master (even for a beginner), and you will become a pro of using it by the end of this article.

I will also be providing some valuables use cases that you may encounter while developing in JavaScript.

<Summary />

## Definition

The `toUpperCase()` function is used to uppercase a string.

Here is the `toUpperCase()` function syntax.

```javascript
yourString.toUpperCase();
```

Here is an example of how you would call that function.

```javascript
const str = "This is a very long string!";

// This will return => "THIS IS A VERY LONG STRING!"
console.log(str.toUpperCase());
```

In that case, it will return: "THIS IS A VERY LONG STRING!".

### 1. Parameters

The `toUpperCase()` function does not accept any parameters.

### 2. Return Value

The `toUpperCase()` function returns the string converted to uppercase.

## Browser Support

## How to uppercase the first letter?

You have a few options to uppercase the first letter of a string.

### 1. Using the `charAt()` with the `slice()` function.

In order to uppercase the first letter of a string you can use the `chatAt()`, `toUpperCase()` and `slice()` functions.

```javascript
const str = "this is a very long string!";

// This will return => "This is a very long string!"
console.log(str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1));
```

In that case, it will return: "This is a very long string!".

### 2. Using the `replace()` function.

Also, you can use the `replace()` function to uppercase the first letter of a string.

```javascript
const str = "this is a very long string!";

// This will return => "This is a very long string!"
console.log(str.replace(/./, c => c.toUpperCase()));
```

In that case, it will return: "This is a very long string!".

## How to uppercase the first letter of each word?

You can use a regex to uppercase the first letter of each word.

```javascript
const str = "This Is A Very Long String!";

// This will return => "This Is A Very Long String!"
console.log(str.replace(/(^|\s)\S/g, (letter) => letter.toUpperCase()));
```

In that case, it will return: "This Is A Very Long String!".

## Final Thoughts

As you can see the `toUpperCase()` is pretty straight and forward and not difficult to master.

Now that you are a pro of this function please share this article with your fellow coders.
