React is a flexible, efficient, and declarative library for developing the user interface. It helps to create complex UIs from small, isolated pieces called "components". Different names have been used interchangeably, such as React.js, ReactJS, and React JS. React was introduced to solve the problems encountered while building JavaScript applications. As the complexity and size of apps were growing, the problems were becoming complex. So, React was created and used by Facebook to cope with their issues to add quality and efficiency while dealing with the same problems on other projects.

## Is React still popular in 2021?

React is still popular and used by developers in their projects due to many reasons. The major reasons for being popular are flexibility, fast rendering, testable, SEO friendliness, and uplifting productivity. It is used for developing applications such as Blogs, E-Learning websites, Job boards and forums, promotional websites, media sharing platforms and galleries, portfolios, business directories, rating websites, coupon sites, and auction sites. The major value added by React is that it can enable developers to build applications fast and deploy them on every platform. 

## What are the benefits of React?

React is still beneficial in 2021 due to its popularity, speed, and development flexibility. If you are wondering why, you should select React in your next project, then go through the following benefits that will help you start working on your project using React easily.

* React is easy to learn: Most developers prefer to use React.js because it is easy to learn, efficient, flexible, and declarative than other JavaScript frameworks. On the other hand, the more difficult a technology to learn, the more time it will take to start the development process. Therefore, an abrupt learning curve is a major reason to use React by learning in a short time. Furthermore, due to its simple nature, businesses are more inclined towards building their projects in React.

* React is Flexible: React is very flexible that demonstrates itself in several ways. First, it is modular. Its architecture permits to use of custom components providing a solid foundation for complete development process optimization. Second, it can be integrated with other third-party libraries and MVC frameworks easily. Finally, developers can create React projects from scratch and slowly can introduce React in their existing codebase.

* Offer fast rendering:  React is a client-side JavaScript library that also can use server-side rendering. Due to enhanced support of server-side rendering, it is robust towards performance-oriented solutions.

* Testable rich user interface: Applications developed with React can increase performance and deliver highly testable applications. Moreover, React make it easier to develop clean architecture.

* Help to boost productivity: React is a library that helps developers boost their performance and has been recognized as one the best front end frameworks.

* Deliver SEO-friendly environment: Applications developed with React can be optimized for search engines. Thus, it becomes easier for Google or other search engines to crawl websites from the server-side to provide HTML responses.

## Are there any disadvantages to using React?

As React provides a lot of advantages, there still exist some disadvantages, which are.

* The high pace of development: It delivers some disadvantages when the environment is continuously changing. Some developers do not feel comfortable learning new ways of doing things regularly. It becomes hard for them to adopt these changes.

* View Part: React covers the UI layers of applications. So, the developers still must choose some other languages to complete the tooling environment of their projects.

* JSX as a barrier: React uses JXS, a syntax extension that permits the use of HTML and JavaScript. This method has many advantages, but many developers consider it as a barrier, especially new developers.

## What makes ReactJS performance faster?

While some best practices help develop applications significantly, there are various right tools available in the market that can make the development process fast. Here are some of them.

* Bit: makes it easy to reuse and share React components across various projects and teams. While developing many applications, it can save development time but turn the components into reusable building blocks. In addition, changes in the components can easily be scanned on different projects.

* Storybook/Styleguidist: This is a rapid development environment for UI components and allows the developers to browse a component library through different states. It helps the developers to build components separately then applications which allow testability and reusability. 

* React DevTools: This is an official React Chrome extension that allows the inspection of different React components in the chrome developer tools. It can also be used as Firefox Add-On.

* Redux DevTools: It is a development time package that delivers powerups for Redux workflow. It permits to inspect of every action and every state.

## React vs Angular

Angular is a JavaScript library built using Typescript, while React is a JavaScript library built using JSX. Angular is used to develop complex applications such as Progressive Web Apps and Single Page apps, while React is used to develop UI components in any app with variable data. React is a package that is used with other programming libraries, while Angular is a complete solution. When it comes to the community then React does not offer much, but Angular has dependable and viable community support. React takes a long time to set up, but it is fast for delivering projects and building applications. The Angular is easy to set up but can increase the coding time, taking a long time to deliver projects. In addition, it needed a set of tools to perform different types of testing. While in the angular debugging and testing for a complete project can be performed with a single tool.

## React vs Angular Performance

One major benefit of the use of React is its speed. With a gzipped size of 43KB, the library is quickly becoming famous for its amazing speed and the numerous options it must make the above possible, for example: using the virtual DOM, support for tree-shaking, and bundling as well as server-side rendering (SSR). In addition, the Angular library can break tasks down into logical chunks, reducing the time it takes to load web pages. Its MVC model also permits the separation of issues by having the view portion located on the client's side, drastically reducing calls to the background. Furthermore, communication using this tool is a unidirectional mode, which means fewer requests to servers will be made.

## React vs Vue
React was designed to address the needs of Facebook, and Facebook's tech company developed it. There was a time when there were questions about Reacts license. Presently React is operating under the MIT License, which allows it to be open source. The backing of Reacts corporate partners, especially from a major player, suggests stability in the future and indicates the possibility that React will continue to develop with support for the long term. Vue, however, on the other side, was created by a single creator, Evan You, to improve the quality of existing JS tools. An ex-Google employee of its Angular group, Evan You, wanted to create a framework that would combine the most effective methods for front-end development from Angular, Ember, and React and other features that made creating Web applications faster, simpler, and more enjoyable. From the beginning, Vue was a truly open-source project and relied on contributors, the community, and crowdfunding to advance.

## React vs Vue Performance

Because React and Vue have some of the same features. Their performance, in general, is similar. Both frameworks make use of virtual DOMs and lazy loading to improve speed and performance. There are instances where one framework surpasses the other. For instance, when you alter the React component's state, all the components within its subtree will be re-drawn too. In Vue, dependencies are monitored to stop unnecessary renders. While you can use immutable data structures, should Component Update, or Pure Component prevents child component re-renders in React. This can add additional complexity and result in DOM state inconsistencies.

## Why use React rather than an other technology?

The main question that is posed to us is why we should choose React. There are many open-source platforms to make the web application development process more efficient such as Angular. Let's take a quick review of the advantages of React over other competing platforms or technologies. The world of front-end development is constantly changing. It can be difficult to dedicate time to learning a brand-new framework, particularly when the framework may eventually be a dead end. If you're looking for the next great thing but are somewhat lost in the maze of frameworks, I suggest you investigate React.

* Simple: ReactJS is just simpler to understand immediately. The components-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and the use of pure JavaScript make React easy to learn to create a professional website (and mobile apps) and allow it to be used. React employs a unique syntax known as JSX, which lets you combine HTML and JavaScript. This isn't a requirement as developers can write simple JavaScript. However, JSX is much simpler to utilize.

* Easy to learn: It is easy to master anyone with some basic experience in programming can grasp React and Angular and Ember, which is described as a 'Domain-specific Language meaning that it's difficult to master these languages. To react, you only require a basic understanding of CSS or HTML.

* Native Methodology: React can be employed to create mobile applications (React Native). Furthermore, React is a fervent advocate of reusability. This means that the code can be reused in a large amount. In addition, we can create IOS, Android, and Web applications.

* Data Binding: React uses one-way data binding, and an application architecture known as Flux manages information flow from components via one point of control: the dispatcher. As a result, it is easier to troubleshoot self-contained components in massive ReactJS applications.

* Performance: React does not provide any notion for a pre-built container to handle dependencies. Browser is a good alternative. Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can utilize through Babel or ReactJS-di to insert dependencies regularly.

* Testability: ReactJS apps are extremely easy to test. React views can be considered as components of the state. Therefore, we can modify the state that is passed into the ReactJS view. Finally, we can look at the results and trigger actions such as events, functions, and more.

## Is React suitable for large applications?

React is the most suitable platform to build large web applications as it's
Simple creation of dynamic web applications: React makes it easy to develop dynamic web-based applications as it doesn't require coding and provides more features when compared to JavaScript, which, while coding, can become very complicated quickly.
Performance improvements: React uses Virtual DOM, which makes web applications more quickly. Virtual DOM analyzes the previous state of components. It only updates the elements within the Real DOM, which were modified as opposed to updating each component once again, as traditional web applications do.

* Reusable parts: Components are the foundation in any React application, and a single application typically includes many components. As a result, they have functions and controls that are reusable throughout your application. That drastically reduces the development time.
* Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when creating a React application, developers typically combine child components with the parent component. Since data is flowing in one direction, it's simpler to identify issues and pinpoint what the source of the issue is within an application that the issue is.

## Is React good for small applications?

React is a wonderful library that allows you to build web-based applications that is less repetitive and encourages you to create components that can be connected using state or props you can transfer from one component to the next. In many applications, it's a useful library to work with, but it could have various features you don't want, particularly for smaller projects like static websites. The ineffective functions can contribute to a huge amount of code and lots of memory, which you can avoid by using software appropriate for small-scale applications.

## Can React be used for mobile app?

Since its introduction in 2013, ReactJS has always contained all the necessary components to become an all-inclusive mobile application development framework. So, the companies across the globe didn't need to take a lot of time to appreciate the value of the framework developed by Facebook. With businesses constantly looking to stay ahead of their competitors, ReactJS has become one of their most important allies. In this article, we will investigate why ReactJS for mobile application development is the most suitable option.

* It provides exceptional cross-platform development and development services.
* It is easier to learn.
* More efficient rendering using Virtual DOM
* ReactJS is beneficial to mobile app developers.
* Code reuse and open source
* ReactJS apps give a native experience.
* Simple maintenance and better SEO performance
* The ideal solution for both mobile and web development
* Solid community support and concrete
* A preferred choice for many fortunes 500 businesses

## What big websites use React?

React features have made it extremely popular to develop websites. Therefore, a lot of famous websites have embraced it. The most well-known websites that use React are:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Netflix
* Airbnb 
* DropBox
* Salesforce
* Uber
* The New York Times
* Reddit
* CNN

## Is it worth learning React?

React.Js is among the essential front ends for development libraries you can make use of. React development is emerging as the next step in web design due to its flexibility and ease. According to a Quora user, "being a master only in a library would be kind of bad thing", but the good thing about React can be that it is a follower of the JavaScript approach to programming, so it is possible to master react and turn you into a master of JavaScript that is a great thing.

## Is React dying?

There is no reason to worry about react being used and react is not just the variety of ways to improve usability. ReactJS is very simple to master and is more targeted than different JavaScript frameworks. Many companies are switching or using the React library due to its simplicity and ease of usage. The ease of learning React is the most significant benefit compared with other front-end frameworks, such as Angular and Vue.

## Conclusion

Front-end web development using React is a raging trend in 2020 and is expected to continue to be popular until 2021. The evidence supporting this statement is solid. Since its initial release in the year 2000, React has been in development since its release. As a result, react library has been continuously developing and getting better. However, components-based architecture, the inclination of React towards functional programming, as well as other unique characteristics in this JS library that we've mentioned in the past, continue to draw increasing numbers of developers to the friendly and friendly React community.
