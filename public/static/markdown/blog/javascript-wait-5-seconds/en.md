There is a lot of use cases where you would want to pause your JavaScript's execution before running the next line. 

Sadly, a function like that is absent from JavaScript's default functionality.

Luckily for us, JavaScript provides a few ways for a developer to wait X seconds before executing the next line of the code.

To complete this task, first of all, you will need to transform seconds into milliseconds.

To transform seconds into milliseconds you will need to multiply your seconds by 1000.

Example:
* 5 seconds = 5000 milliseconds
* 1 second = 1000 milliseconds

_____________________________

Here are three methods that will help you implement it yourself.

## 1. How To Wait 5 Seconds With A Helper Function

*This method will not work if you need to support legacy browsers.*

```javascript
const sleep = async (milliseconds) => {
    await new Promise(resolve => {
		return setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds)
	});
};

const testSleep = async () => {
    console.log('Step 1 - Called');
    await sleep(5000);
    console.log('Step 2 - Called');
}

testSleep();
```

## 2. How To Wait 5 Seconds In A Loop

Here, we are reusing the sleep helper function that we made earlier.

```javascript
const sleep = async (milliseconds) => {
    await new Promise(resolve => {
		return setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds)
	});
};

const testSleep = async () => {
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		await sleep(1000);
		console.log(i);
	}

	console.log("The loop is finished :)");
}

testSleep();
```

## 3. How To Wait 5 Seconds In ES5

If you need to support old browsers ðŸ˜ž, you will not be able to use [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or async & await. 

In that case you will need to use callbacks.

```javascript
var testSleep = function () {
    console.log('Step 1 - Called');
	setTimeout(function () {
    	console.log('Step 2 - Called');
	}, 5000);
}

testSleep();
```

## 4. Wait 5 Seconds in ES5 (DO NOT USE). 

Another way to pause your code for 5 seconds is to use the Date object with a while statement.

This is very inefficient (because it runs on the main thread).

It is only provided here for educational purposes.

```javascript
function syncDelay(milliseconds){
	var start = new Date().getTime();
	var end = 0;

	while((end - start) < milliseconds){
		end = new Date().getTime();
	}
}

console.log('Step 1 - Called');
syncDelay(5000);
console.log('Step 2 - Called');
```
## Conclusion

Now you know how to wait 5 seconds before executing your next line. 

Of course, you can wait for however long you want ðŸ˜‰ it was just an example.
