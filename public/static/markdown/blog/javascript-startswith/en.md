When you will finish reading this guide you will become a pro of JavaScript's startsWith function.

You will know how to use it and when to use it.

<Summary />

## Definition

The startsWith function is used to determine if a string begins by the search value.

If the string begins by the search value, it returns *true*, otherwise, it returns *false*.

```javascript

```

Here are some things that you need to take into considerations:

1. This function is **case sensitive**.
2. You can specify a start position (completely optional).


### Parameters

| Parameters | Necessity | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| searchValue | Required | The value to search for. |
| start | Optional | The default position is 0, but you can specify your own. |

### Return Value

This method will return a *boolean*.

**true** => if startsWith the search value.

**false** => if does not startsWith the search value. 

### Browser Support

This method only works on browsers that support ES2015.

| Browser | Support |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | YES ✅ |
| Firefox | YES ✅ |
| Opera | YES ✅ |
| Safari | YES ✅ |
| Edge | YES ✅ |
| Internet Explorer | No ❌ |

*To support legacy browsers like Internet Explorer you will need to add a polyfill.*
