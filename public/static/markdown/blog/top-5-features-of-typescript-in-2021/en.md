Here are my 5 favorite features of TypeScript:

## TypeScript is more explicit than JavaScript

Perhaps its biggest advantage compared to JavaScript is its addition of typings, which ensures a more robust and explicit code.

Also, adding new programmers to the project is much quicker since they spend less time understanding your code and more time writing it.
